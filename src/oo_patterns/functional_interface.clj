;; Notes
;;Since Functional Interface is implemented with a class, it defines a type and can use common object-oriented features such as subclassing and polymorphism. Higher-order functions cannot. This is actually a strength of higher-order functions over Functional Interface: you donâ€™t need a new type for each type of Functional Interface when just the existing function types will do.
