;; Notes
;;Since Functional Interface is implemented with a class, it defines a
;;type and can use common object-oriented features such as subclassing
;;and polymorphism. Higher-order functions cannot. This is actually a
;;strength of higher-order functions over Functional Interface: you
;;donâ€™t need a new type for each type of Functional Interface when
;;just the existing function types will do.

;;  Intent
;; To encapsulate a bit of program logic so that it can be passed
;; around, stored in data structures, and generally treated like any
;; other first-class construct

;; Overview
;; Functional Interface is a basic object-oriented design pattern. It
;; consists of an interface with a single method with a name like run,
;; execute, perform, apply, or some other generic verb.
;; Implementations of Functional Interface perform a single
;; well-defined action, as any method should.

;; Functional Interface lets us call an object as if it were a
;; function, which lets us pass verbs around our program rather than
;; nouns. This turns the traditional object-oriented view of the world
;; on its head a bit. In the strict object-oriented view, objects,
;; which are nouns, are king. Verbs, or methods, are second-class
;; citizens, always attached to an object, doomed to a life of
;; servitude to their noun overlords.
